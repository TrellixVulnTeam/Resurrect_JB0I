            <ul class="features">
              <li class="icon fa-heart">
                <h3>Passed Friend and Family</h3>
                <p>People lose their friends and family more often than expected. People can pass away at any time, and people often feel empty without them. Having a way to remember them and the interactions is a great way to adjust to life without them and make sure they are not forgotten. While pictures and videos are a way to reminisce, having a conversation with that person, real or not, would please many people.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="icon solid fa-stethoscope">
                <h3>Mentally Deteriorating Elders</h3>
                <p>In addition to passed family members and friends, many people have grandparents or other elders in their life who become less and less able to hold a conversation, as their mental health deteriorates. Having a method to hold conversations with these elders and have a peace of mind could be through AI adaptations of them, where you would feel satisfied. Hearing their voice and reading messages that resemble their texting method will compensate for the loved elders who can’t communicate anymore.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="icon solid fa-star">
                <h3>Late Celebrities and Public Figures</h3>
                <p>Celebrities seem to be passing more and more often these days. From megastar athletes to inspiring artists, many people dream to meet these celebrities once in their life, but the opportunities have been cut short by their untimely death. Celebrities often have a large social media presence, and through their social media, people are able to have a strong understanding of their personalities. However, having a conversation with that personality and asking them questions is still not possible, until now.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="icon fa-clipboard">
                <h3>Counseling and Community Presence</h3>
                <p>For those who struggle with the untimely losses of their friends and family, counseling and support is the best option. However, high-quality counseling is often unavailable, and when it is available, it’s incredibly expensive. Having access to free counseling and credible advice and support is key, and the best way to mass supply it is through creating AI bots and adaptations to address everyone. Furthermore, building a community of people who face the same struggles and losses takes away the sense of loneliness and helps people recover.</p>

              <h2>Find your Friends</h2>
              <p>We developed an AI algorithm using PyTorch and Tensorflow that requires users to input text conversations with their loved ones. This can be someone they have lost recently, or a partner they have broken up with or an elderly who struggled to communicate. We will then process their request and return an AI adaptation that they can interact with. If you wish, you can submit an audio clip of your friend, and we can have the AI speak to you in their voice. For those who have recently lost a friend or family member, this is a great coping mechanism to never lose memory of your friend.</p>

              <h2>Chat with Late Celebrities</h2>
              <p>We developed another AI algorithm that uses a Twitter web scraper to bring your favorite late celebrities back in an AI form. By interacting and conversing with the adaptation, you will experience what an interaction with them would have been when they were still around and if you were able to meet them, fulfilling your dreams of meeting your favorite late celebrities.</p>

              <h2>Counseling and Coping</h2>
              <p>Lastly, we developed a counseling bot trained on data from multiple counselor forums. If you are struggling with the loss of your loved one or any other mental health issues, you can use our counseling page. Interact with the bot and ask questions to get advice and free counseling, especially during a time where getting in-person counseling is difficult. Our bot is trained on conversations, posts, and opinions from the most qualified counselors from different fields.</p>

Our model uses supervised learning to then generate coordinates on where it is most risky, which we then render using GeoPandas.</p>
